## What to do

- After QA fail (human-loop spec 5.2), when the check says the item failed QA and asks which defects go to whom: read
  the newest QA report on the item (`getJiraIssue`), list its FAIL rows and its Notes for the human in Vietnamese, and
  propose a split, each part starting a line with `be:` or `fe:`. When they say OK, or give their own split, write it,
  as it is, to `.ai/runs/<KEY>/note.md`, where KEY is the item, and run the command below with
  `--note .ai/runs/<KEY>/note.md` added. Never put that text in a shell command. When the text after the key above
  already splits the defects that way, use it as it is. After QA fail of an item with one dev agent, text after the key
  goes the same way, as words for that agent: write it to `note.md` and add `--note`.
- On any other STOP, tell the human the reason and the command or clicks it names, in Vietnamese, and stop.
- On GO, run `node .ai-orchestrator/scripts/ao-step.mjs build $0 --go` with the Bash tool in the background, with a
  timeout of 7200000 ms, and wait for its notification. Do not poll.
  Do not run any agent yourself, and do not change Jira or GitHub yourself.
- Then read `.ai/runs/<KEY>/last.md`, where KEY is the item the check printed, and report in Vietnamese: what each
  agent did and cost, the questions left, what the human must do at a gate (numbered clicks), and the next command.
- When the build ends at a draft PR, list the files in `.ai/runs/<KEY>/preview/` (the screenshots of `fe-dev`, the
  API samples of `be-dev`), and give the human the two ways on: `/ao-preview <KEY>` to run the apps on the PR branch,
  or `/ao-review <PR>` to skip the preview. To ask for changes after the preview, they write
  `/ao-fix <PR> be: … fe: …`.
