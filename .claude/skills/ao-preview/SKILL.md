## Check

!`node .ai-orchestrator/scripts/ao-step.mjs preview $0`

## What the human wrote

$ARGUMENTS

## What to do

No agent runs here (human-loop spec 4.3).

- When the text above ends with `--stop`, run `node .ai-orchestrator/scripts/ao-step.mjs preview $0 --stop --go` with
  the Bash tool, with a timeout of 600000 ms. Then tell the human, in Vietnamese, what it stopped and the branch the
  project folder is on now, with any file it names that appeared during the preview, and stop. Do not read, change or
  delete such a file yourself.
- On STOP, tell the human the reason and the command or clicks it names, in Vietnamese, and stop. When the check
  prints a sample of the apps of `project.yaml`, show it as it is.
- When the check prints neither STOP nor GO but a state, such as `The preview of <KEY> runs on <branch>: …` or
  `No preview runs.`, followed by `Next:`, nothing is wrong: tell the human, in Vietnamese, what runs and its URLs, and
  the `Next:` command, and stop. Run nothing yourself.
- On GO, run `node .ai-orchestrator/scripts/ao-step.mjs preview $0 --go` with the Bash tool, with a timeout of
  600000 ms, and wait for it. It puts the project folder on the PR branch, runs `npm ci` when the lockfile changed,
  and starts the apps, which keep running after it ends. Do not start, stop or change anything yourself.
- Then report in Vietnamese:
  - the URLs to open;
  - that the project folder is on the PR branch, and that the apps run code no reviewer has read yet, on this machine:
    no secret variable of the session reaches them, but they run under the human's Windows user, so they can read
    the human's files, the App key files and the variables of `HKCU\Environment`;
  - that the apps can also write in the project folder, files git does not track included, such as `CLAUDE.local.md`
    or `.claude/settings.local.json`, which the next session would load; `--stop` names those that appeared during the
    preview, and does not delete them;
  - not to edit files while the preview runs;
  - to ask for changes, `/ao-fix <PR> be: … fe: …`, which stops the preview first;
  - when done, `/ao-preview <KEY> --stop`, or `/ao-review <PR>`, which stops it too.
