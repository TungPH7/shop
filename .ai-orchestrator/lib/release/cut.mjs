// Cut point (release-workflow spec 2.6, docs/sdlc.md): the newest commit on the first-parent history of develop such
// that every item with a commit up to it is Done, and none of those items has a commit after it. Items after the cut
// point go to the next release. A pure function: the caller reads the history with git and the states from Jira.

// commits: the first-parent history of develop since the newest release tag, oldest first, each { sha, subject, keys }
// with the work item keys it names. items: the contract state of each item by key ('done', 'in-qa', ...).
// Returns { cut, included, after, cancelled }: `cut` is the commit of the cut point, or null when no commit up to a cut
// point holds a Done item (guard cut-point-ready); `included` and `after` list { key, state }, in the order of each
// item's first commit. Only Done counts: an item without a state, such as one Jira does not know, holds the cut point
// back until you sort it out.
// epics: the keys that are Epics. An Epic is not released, its children are, and it completes only after they reach
// Production, so a commit that names one, such as its spec, goes with the cut point that covers it.
// A Cancelled item does not hold the cut point either (Pilot 2): Cancelled is a final state, so an item
// cancelled after its merge would hold every later cut point back for good. Its commits go out with the cut point that
// covers them, and `cancelled` lists those items apart, so you see at gate ④ the code that ships without an item Done
// behind it. Revert it on develop first if it should not ship.
